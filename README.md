# Setlists

A place for bands and their mates.

## Bands:

  - Admin: Full read/write/delete permissions for the band as well as its setlists, songs, and feels. Admins are capable of removing/inviting members as well as deleting the band.
  - Member: Read only permissions for band specific settings, but full read/write/delete permissions for setlists, songs, and feels.
  - Sub: Read only permissions throughout the app.

## Setlists:

Setlists are made up of one or more groups of songs or "sets". Setlists can be auto-generated or manually created. They can be updated by changing the order of songs or sets or adding/removing songs/sets.

Setlists can be shared publically if desired. This allows bands to share setlists with their fans or a sound tech or fill who may perform their job better with a setlist.

Data metrics are available for setlists so band members can get a sense of cover to original ratio, overall feels of a set, as well as the tempo composition of a set.

## Songs:

Songs make up each set. Songs include information used to auto-generate setlists like length of the song (in minutes), prefered position in the set (opener/closer/other), and whether or not it should always be skipped for auto-generation.

Additional information can be added to a song like lyrics, artist information, external links, key, tempo, feel, etc.

## Feels:

Feels can be added to songs to help categorize them. Tempos can be added, removed, and edited from the Band Settings page.

## Issues

There are probably a number of yet to be found bugs. Open an issue (or even better, Pull Request) if you come across any.

Feature requests will be entertained, but not guaranteed.
